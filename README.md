# Finding-Correlated-pairs-among-Nifty500-scrips-employing-Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-

This methodology is inspired by the  paper named -'Identifying Highly Correlated Stocks Using the
Last Few Principal Components', which are nothing but the last few eigenvectors of the decomposed covariance matrix, to find correlations which are otherwise disguised.
The results of this type of analysis can easily be used for portfolio contruction 
dictated by the investors risk appetite.
